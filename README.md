# What IS JIS-100?
 This is a single-node remake of the backend of TIS-100.
 I try to keep compatiblity to TIS-100 as much as possible here. (so practically no functional difference in instructions)
# Why single-node?
 I want to put the responsiblity of managing multiple nodes up to the user. (also because i tried to do multi-node before but i got sidetracked (and stuck) on making multiple nodes work)
# What even is this useful for?
 Language servers, quick debugging, maybe even making programming languages for the TIS-100!
